# filecategorizer
PowerShell script that helps you consolidate different file extensions into their own folders.
This script will first set the path to the directory where the files are located, and then define the list of extensions to group the files by. It will then loop through each extension, and for each one it will get a list of all files with that extension in the specified directory. If there are any files with the current extension, it will create a new folder for the extension and then loop through each file, moving it to the new folder.  Note that this script assumes that the extensions are specified without a leading dot (e.g. ".doc" instead of "doc"). If you want to specify the extensions with a leading dot, you can modify the script to remove the leading dot when creating the new folder and moving the files.
